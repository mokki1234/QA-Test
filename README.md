# Simple Selenium Website Testing

This repository contains sample code for automating website testing using Selenium WebDriver. The examples are written in Java, but you can adapt them to other programming languages as needed.

## Prerequisites

1. **Selenium Installation**: Make sure you have Selenium installed. You can find detailed installation instructions in the [official Selenium documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/first_script/).

2. **Web Browser Driver**: You'll need the appropriate web browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) installed. Refer to the Selenium documentation for instructions on setting up the driver for your preferred browser.

## Getting Started

1. **Start the Session**:
   Initialize the WebDriver instance. For example, in Java:

   ```java
   WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Web Page**:
   Use the `driver.get()` method to navigate to a specific URL:

   ```java
   driver.get("https://rahulshettyacademy.com/dropdownsPractise/");
   ```

3. **Find an Element**:
   Locate specific web elements on the page using selectors (e.g., by name, CSS selector):

   ```java
    driver.findElement(By.id("ctl00_mainContent_ddl_originStation1_CTXT")).click();
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("//a[@value='BLR']")).click();
   ```

4. **Take Action on Elements**:
   Interact with elements (e.g., send keys, click):

		//driver.findElement(By.xpath("//a[@value='MAA'])[2]")).click();
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[@id='ctl00_mainContent_ddl_destinationStation1_CTNR'] //a[@value='MAA']")).click();
		//Calendar Code
		Thread.sleep(2000);
		driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(".ui-state-default.ui-state-highlight")).click(); 


5. **End the Session**:
   Quit the driver to close the browser:

   ```java
   driver.quit();
   ```
